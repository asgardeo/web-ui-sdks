/**
 * Constants related to OpenID Connect (OIDC) metadata and endpoints.
 * This object contains all the standard OIDC endpoints and storage keys
 * used throughout the application for authentication and authorization.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The constants are organized into two main sections:
 * 1. Endpoints - Contains all OIDC standard endpoint paths
 * 2. Storage - Contains keys used for storing OIDC-related data
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Using an endpoint
 * const authEndpoint = OIDCMetadataConstants.Endpoints.AUTHORIZATION;
 *
 * // Using a storage key
 * const tokenKey = OIDCMetadataConstants.Storage.StorageKeys.Endpoints.TOKEN;
 * ```
